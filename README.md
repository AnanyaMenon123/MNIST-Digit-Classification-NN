# MNIST-Digit-Classification-NN
Classification of MNIST digits from MNIST dataset from keras.datasets , using an Artificial Neural Network. Image preprocessing done using tools such as Pillow, OpenCV and matplotlib along with scaling and resizing. Converted to a format that an ANN can understand. Training Accuracy is 98% and Testing Accuracy is 97.31%. Visualization done using a heatmap, comparing ground truth labels and predicted labels by the model. Finally, we build a predictive system, with an image not present on the test dataset i.e, something that the model has not seen before.
